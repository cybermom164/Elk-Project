## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram] RedTeam-Project1

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Elk file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly responsive, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?
	* The load balancer protects sever against DDoS attacts. 
	* The jumpbox manage device from antoher security zone.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the data and system log.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?
* The Filebeat  log files and track the output.
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_
*The Metricbeat record machin metrics like cpu and memeory. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| VM Name | Function | IP Address   | Operation |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Jumpbox | Gateway  | 40.76.12.172 | Linux     |
| Web 1   | Server   | 10.0.0.5     | Linux     |
| Web 2   | Server   | 10.0.0.7     | Linux     |
| Web 3   | Server   | 10.0.0.8     | Linux     |
| Elk     | Sever    | 10.1.0.4     | Linux     |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Elk and Web 1 machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- My IP Address

Machines within the network can only be accessed by .
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| VM Name | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Address          |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Jumpbox | n                   | My IP Address               |
| Web 1   | y                   | My IP Address, 40.76.12.172 |
| Web 2   | n                   | 40.76.12.172                |
| Web 3   | n                   | 40.76.12.172                |
| Elk     | y                   | My IP Address,40.76.12.172  |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
The main advantage of the automating configuration of the Ansible container is that it reads YML.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- Install Docker
- Install python3-pip
-Increase Virtual Machine Memory
-Download  a docker elk container
-launch docker elk container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO:10.0.0.7, 10.1.0.4, 10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Filebeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

- Filebeat,  logs files and location. Read a log for new information or content.
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-playbook.yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the filebeat-playbook.yml file to include ip address 
- Run the playbook, and navigate to  Elk machine to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it? filebeat.playbook to filebeat.yml
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? Specify it in the filebeat configuration file.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://104.208.38.95:5601/app/kibana#/home

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
